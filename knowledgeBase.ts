SOSORT 2016 GUIDELINES: ORTHOPAEDIC AND REHABILITATION TREATMENT OF IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS DURING GROWTH

Key Definitions:
- Scoliosis: A general term for changes in the shape and position of the spine, thorax, and trunk.
- Idiopathic Scoliosis (IS): Scoliosis of unknown origin, affecting 80% of cases.
- AIS (Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis): Cobb angle above 10° in the general population.

Goals of Conservative Treatment (Table 4):
1. Stop curve progression at puberty.
2. Prevent or treat respiratory dysfunction.
3. Prevent or treat spinal pain syndromes.
4. Improve aesthetics via postural correction.

Strength of Evidence (Table 1):
I: Multiple RCTs or Systematic Reviews.
II: One RCT.
III: Multiple controlled non-randomized studies.
IV: Other studies.
V: SOSORT consensus > 90% agreement.
VI: SOSORT consensus 70-89% agreement.

Strength of Recommendation (Table 2):
A: Applied widely to all patients.
B: Important, but doesn't have to be applied to all.
C: Less important, applied voluntarily.
D: Very low importance.

Bracing Recommendations (Table 10):
- Recommendation 1: Bracing recommended for AIS (Grade B, Evidence I).
- Recommendation 3: Use brace in evolutive IS above 25° during growth.
- Recommendation 5: Not recommended below 15°±5° Cobb unless justified.
- Recommendation 6: Recommended above 20°±5° Cobb if growing (Risser 0-3) and progressing.
- Recommendation 9: Worn full time or no less than 18h/day at start.
- Recommendation 10 & 11: Dose-response relationship - hours per day proportional to severity.

Bracing Types (Definitions):
- NTRB (Night Time Rigid Bracing): 8-12 hours per day.
- SB (Soft Bracing): e.g., SpineCor.
- PTRB (Part Time Rigid Bracing): 12-20 hours per day.
- FTRB (Full Time Rigid Bracing) or Cast: 20-24 hours per day.

PSSE (Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis-Specific Exercises) (Table 11):
- Recommendation 1: PSSE recommended as first step to treat IS to prevent progression (Grade C, Evidence I).
- Key components: Auto-correction in 3D, Training in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Stabilizing corrected posture, Patient education.

Assessment (Table 16):
- School screening: Recommended for early diagnosis (Grade B, Evidence IV).
- Adam’s forward bend test: Used with Scoliometer.
- Referral criteria: 5° and 7° angle of trunk rotation (ATR) (Grade B, Evidence V).
- Radiography: Lateral view at start is essential for sagittal profile assessment.

Progression Risk (Bunnell):
- Risk at start of puberty: 20% in 10° scoliosis, 60% in 20° scoliosis, 90% in 30° scoliosis.
